## üöÄ Deployment Guide

> üí° _Note: AWS charges approx ‚Çπ0.52/hr for the EC2 instance used._

### 1. Deploy Passbolt via AWS Marketplace

- Go to [Passbolt AWS Marketplace Page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)
- Select **Passbolt Community Edition**
- Choose the desired instance type and region
- Create a **Security Group** allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22)
- Generate a **Key Pair** for SSH access

### 2. SSH Key Setup

- ssh-keygen

- Press Enter to confirm default path
- This creates your public/private key pair (usually in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

### 3. Launch & Access EC2 Instance

- Launch the EC2 instance from AWS Console
- Use the public IP address to SSH into the instance:

- ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>

### 4. Configure Passbolt

- Visit your EC2 instance‚Äôs public IP in a browser
- Begin the setup wizard
- Generate server GPG keys
- Optionally configure SMTP (for future email notifications)
- Set Admin User credentials

### 5. Install Chrome Extension & Finalize

- Download the Passbolt Chrome Extension
- Create a strong 15+ character passphrase
- Choose a Security Token for 2FA
- Login via the browser extension

üîê Security Measures
All data encrypted in transit via SSL/TLS

Server access restricted via SSH key-pairs

Strong password and passphrase policies enforced

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled using browser extension

Hosted in a secure AWS environment following least privilege access model

üì¶ Usage
Login through Chrome using your Passphrase + 2FA token

Store, manage, and share passwords securely

Admin panel accessible for managing users and permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
SMTP not fully configured (limits email-based features)

Currently no backup automation in place

Domain HTTPS setup requires manual configuration (if desired)

üå± Future Enhancements
Configure SMTP for email notifications (password resets, invites)

Automate EC2 backup snapshots for disaster recovery

Integrate domain with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt

Dockerize deployment for portability

Monitoring and logging via CloudWatch
